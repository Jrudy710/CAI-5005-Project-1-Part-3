# CAI-5005-Project-1-Part-3

This will be a solver that uses the minimax algorithm and then alpha-beta pruning algorithm to ascertain the victory between two players. One starting at the top left, and the other at the top right. The game will end when all of the resources have been delivered back to the respective bases and the winner will be determined by whoever has obtained the most resources.
